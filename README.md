##  How to Play / Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Enable **two-player mode** on the same device (currently supports local play).
* Add **AI/opponent** for single-player mode — easy, medium, or hard difficulty.
* Introduce a **reset button** and **scorekeeper** to track wins/draws.
* Include **mobile touch optimization** and **dynamic styling** (e.g., themes or dark mode).
* Add UI flair like **animations** or move history.
